    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p> 1. Introduction<br>

Cricket is a widely played outdoor sport that involves two teams of eleven players each. It is a bat-and-ball game that tests a player’s physical fitness, mental strength, and tactical understanding. The game is played on a large field and follows a structured set of rules that ensure fair play. Cricket is known for its long duration, strategic depth, and strong emphasis on discipline and teamwork. Over the years, it has grown from a simple recreational activity into a professional global sport.<br>

2. Historical Background<br>

The game of cricket originated in England during the 16th century and was initially played by children in rural areas. With time, it became popular among adults and spread to different parts of the world due to British colonization. The establishment of formal rules helped standardize the game. Today, international cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which organizes global tournaments and ensures uniform playing conditions across nations.<br>

3. Cricket Playing Area<br>

A cricket field is usually circular or oval in shape and is surrounded by a boundary line that defines the playing area. At the center of the field lies the pitch, which measures exactly 22 yards in length. The pitch plays a crucial role in the game as it affects the movement of the ball. Two sets of wickets are placed at either end of the pitch, and they are essential for scoring runs and dismissing batsmen.<br>

4. Team Composition and Player Roles<br>

Each cricket team consists of eleven players, and each player has a specific role to perform. Batsmen are responsible for scoring runs and building the team’s total. Bowlers aim to take wickets and restrict the flow of runs. All-rounders contribute both in batting and bowling, making them valuable team members. The wicket-keeper plays a vital role in catching the ball, effecting stumpings, and guiding field placements.<br>

5. Cricket Equipment<br>

Cricket requires a variety of equipment to ensure safety and proper gameplay. The bat is traditionally made from willow wood and is designed to hit the ball effectively. The cricket ball is made of leather and has a hard cork core, allowing it to travel at high speeds. Wickets consist of stumps and bails, which are used to dismiss batsmen. Players wear protective gear such as helmets, pads, gloves, and guards to prevent injuries.<br>

6. Innings, Overs, and Match Structure<br>

A cricket match is divided into innings, during which one team bats while the other bowls and fields. An innings may end when all batsmen are dismissed or when the predetermined number of overs is completed. An over consists of six legal deliveries bowled by a bowler. The structured nature of overs and innings helps maintain balance and fairness in the game.<br>

7. Scoring System<br>

Runs in cricket are scored by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. Batsmen may also score runs by hitting boundaries, which are awarded four or six runs depending on how the ball crosses the boundary. Extra runs are given for illegal deliveries such as wides and no-balls. Byes and leg byes also contribute to the team’s total score even though the bat does not make contact with the ball.<br>

8. Methods of Dismissal<br>

There are several ways in which a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. A batsman is said to be bowled if the ball hits the stumps. If the ball is caught by a fielder without bouncing, the batsman is declared out. LBW occurs when the ball strikes the batsman’s leg and would have hit the stumps. Other methods include run out, stumped, and hit wicket, each governed by specific rules.<br>

9. Bowling Techniques<br>

Bowlers use different techniques to challenge batsmen and gain wickets. Fast bowlers rely on speed and bounce to trouble batsmen, while swing bowlers focus on movement through the air. Spin bowlers use wrist or finger movements to spin the ball and deceive the batsman. Each bowling style requires skill, practice, and a deep understanding of pitch conditions.<br>

10. Fielding and Field Placements<br>

Fielding is an essential aspect of cricket that involves stopping the ball, catching it, and preventing runs. Fielders are positioned strategically around the ground to support the bowler’s plan. Positions such as slip, cover, mid-on, mid-off, and fine leg are commonly used. Good fielding can change the outcome of a match by saving runs and creating wicket-taking opportunities.<br>

11. Formats of Cricket<br>

Cricket is played in various formats to suit different audiences and playing conditions. Test cricket is the longest format and is played over five days, requiring patience and endurance. One Day Internationals (ODIs) limit each team to fifty overs, balancing strategy and speed. Twenty20 (T20) cricket is the shortest format and focuses on fast-paced, entertaining gameplay.<br>

12. Use of Technology in Cricket<br>

Modern cricket has embraced technology to improve decision-making and fairness. Tools such as the Decision Review System (DRS), Hawk-Eye, and UltraEdge help umpires make accurate decisions. Technology also assists teams in performance analysis and strategy planning. The use of technology has enhanced the credibility of the game.<br>

13. Spirit of Cricket<br>

The spirit of cricket represents the ethical values and sportsmanship associated with the game. Players are expected to respect the rules, officials, opponents, and spectators. Fair play, honesty, and integrity are core principles of the spirit of cricket. These values distinguish cricket from many other sports.<br>

14. Popularity and Global Impact<br>

Cricket enjoys massive popularity in countries such as India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and the West Indies. International tournaments and domestic leagues attract millions of viewers worldwide. Cricket has become a cultural phenomenon that unites people across different backgrounds and nations.</p>
